The attached diagram illustrates the process of a plan-based payment system in a service app using Stripe. It showcases the following sequential steps:

1. **Customer selects a subscription plan**: The customer chooses a plan that suits their needs.
2. **Customer enters payment details**: The customer provides their payment information.
3. **Stripe tokenizes payment data**: Stripe securely converts sensitive payment data into tokens for safe storage.
4. **Stripe processes payment**: Stripe handles the transaction, ensuring funds are transferred securely.
5. **Payment confirmation sent to customer**: The customer receives confirmation of the successful transaction.
6. **Funds transferred to business account**: Stripe transfers the collected funds to the business's account.

This flow emphasizes Stripe's role in ensuring secure, efficient, and user-friendly payment processing for subscription-based services.
