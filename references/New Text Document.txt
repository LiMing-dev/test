Using **NVM (Node Version Manager)** is generally better than using **YUM** for installing Node.js on AWS Linux. Here's why:

### Advantages of NVM:
1. **Version Management**: NVM allows you to install and switch between multiple versions of Node.js, which is useful if your projects require different versions[1][2][7].
2. **Flexibility**: You can easily update to the latest LTS (Long-Term Support) or specific versions of Node.js without relying on system package managers, which may offer outdated versions[1][4].
3. **User-Specific Installation**: NVM installs Node.js in the user's directory, avoiding potential permission issues when managing global npm packages[4][7].

### Disadvantages of NVM:
- Node.js installed via NVM is user-specific, meaning it won't be globally available to all users unless explicitly configured[8].

### Advantages of YUM:
1. **Global Installation**: Node.js installed via YUM is available system-wide, making it accessible to all users without additional configuration[8].
2. **Simplicity**: For basic setups or single-version requirements, YUM provides a straightforward method to install Node.js.

### Disadvantages of YUM:
- The version of Node.js provided by YUM repositories is often outdated, which can lead to compatibility issues with modern applications[1][4].
- Managing multiple versions of Node.js is cumbersome and not natively supported by YUM.

### Recommendation:
Use **NVM** if you need flexibility, multiple versions, or the latest Node.js releases. Use **YUM** only for simple setups where a single global installation suffices and version control is not a concern.
