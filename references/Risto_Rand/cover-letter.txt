Dear,

With six years of experience in software development across diverse environments, I have honed my skills in building responsive, scalable applications and architecting robust backend solutions. 

At Smart Soft Team, I developed user-centric web applications with React and Angular, built backend services with Django, and optimized APIs using Node.js and GraphQL, significantly improving performance. I also automated deployment pipelines with AWS CodePipeline for streamlined delivery and scalability.

Previously, as a Full Stack Developer at Anais Digital, I created single-page applications with React and Next.js, developed APIs for SAAS platforms with Django and Flask, and managed complex databases. This role taught me to balance technical efficiency with customer-focused features. Earlier, as a Frontend Developer at MeGaDev, I built optimized interfaces with Vue and SASS, integrated blockchain components, and set up CI/CD pipelines with GitHub, enhancing reliability and speed.

My background in frontend, backend, and deploymentwith a focus on user-centered applications, has prepared me well to contribute meaningfully to your team. Thank you for considering my application, and I look forward to the opportunity to discuss this in greater detail.

Sincerely,
Risto
